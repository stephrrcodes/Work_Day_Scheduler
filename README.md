# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
    As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that i can manage my time effectively. 

## Acceptance Criteria
    This is a daily planner with the ability to create a schedule.
    When you open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top.
    When you scroll down, you are presented with time blocks for standard business hours. 
    When you view the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present and future.
    When you click into the time-block, you can enter text and create a event.
    when you click the save button for that time block,then the text for that event is saved in local storage.
    When you refresh the page, the saved event stays on the schedule.
